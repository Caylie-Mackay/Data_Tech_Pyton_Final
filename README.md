## Data Manipulation:
In order to find the top ten salaries in the dataset I was needed to use the Sort_values manipulation. Seeing the top ten people with the highest salaries helps me understand what jobs pay the best and how many years of experience these people have, so I can see if the pay is comparable or very subjective.
I used the Group_by manipulation a lot to help me aggregate the dataset to find the statistics I wanted.

## Visualizations:
The graph below gives us insight into what the most commen job titles were for this sample. This could help us to know what industries hire more people, and we can be more assured in our findings about these jobs due to having a larger sample size.

This next graph helps to showcase the difference in years of experience between the male sample and female sample. As shown the median for both genders is quite similar the range and distribution of years of exerience for male participants leans into having more experience. To find out more about the reason behind this difference we would have to conduct another survey since this dataset does not have information that would help us find the reason.

This graph highlights the difference in salary when grouped by education. This is a helpful visual as it shows us which education levels receive the highest salary and what the difference between them is. As expected PhD and Master degree students receive the highest salary, however the most commen salary in the dataset was aroud 50000 and these people are mostly Bachelor degree students.

This final graph not only shows salary when compared to years of experience, but also seperates it between male and female participants and education level. This allows us to see overarching trends and also see if there are any unique trend that we didn't see in our earlier exploration. Everything looks to be as we expected and we can even see that no matter your gender or education level the more years of experience you have the higher your salary is likely to be.

## Purpose and Results
Accross all of my analysis the biggest trends that I observed was the positive correlations between age and salary as well as the positive correlation between years of experience and salary. This means that the older ytou are or the more years of experience you have the more likely your salary will be higher. I also observed taht on average women had lower years of experience and salary when compared to men. This could be because of things like child birth or education oppertunities but would need to be looked into more since this dataset does not have the data to help us know why there is a difference in salary.
