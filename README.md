## Data Manipulation:
In order to find the top ten salaries in the dataset I was needed to use the Sort_values manipulation. Seeing the top ten people with the highest salaries helps me understand what jobs pay the best and how many years of experience these people have, so I can see if the pay is comparable or very subjective.
I used the Group_by manipulation a lot to help me aggregate the dataset to find the statistics I wanted.

## Purpose and Results
Accross all of my analysis the biggest trends that I observed was the positive correlations between age and salary as well as the positive correlation between years of experience and salary. This means that the older ytou are or the more years of experience you have the more likely your salary will be higher. I also observed taht on average women had lower years of experience and salary when compared to men. This could be because of things like child birth or education oppertunities but would need to be looked into more since this dataset does not have the data to help us know why there is a difference in salary.
